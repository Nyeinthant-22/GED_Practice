    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Neutrals (Slate background, Blue and Green accents) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page, one-question-at-a-time interactive quiz. This structure focuses the user, simulates a real test environment, and provides immediate, detailed feedback on a results screen. This is superior to a static list for active learning and self-assessment because it encourages active recall and pinpoints areas needing improvement. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The source report (a practice test) is converted into a dynamic quiz. Goal: Test knowledge and provide structured feedback. Method: Presenting questions and clickable options one by one using dynamically updated HTML, styled with Tailwind CSS. Interaction: User selects answers, navigates with 'Next'/'Previous' buttons, and gets a final score with a comprehensive review list. Justification: This interactive format is highly engaging and effective for study, turning passive reading into an active learning exercise. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for all quiz logic, Tailwind CSS for styling. No charts needed as the content is text-based. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
